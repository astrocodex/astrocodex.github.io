    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "These exercises assume: \n",
    "1. Basic knowledge of python coding\n",
    "2. Basic knowledge of RA/DEC cooridinates for finding star clusters\n",
    "3. Basic knowledge of how color magnitude diagrams are generated. More information on Star Clusters from this website [HR Diagrams and Cluster Evolution](https://openpress.usask.ca/skynet/chapter/hr-diagrams/).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction - Data Reduction\n",
    "In this activity, we will demonstrate how code can be used to query data from Gaia Data Release 3 to generate a color magnitude diagram. However, when it comes to extracting data from any database, it is important to be sure you are evaluating the data from your source. Often, data may have some values that do not make sense, such as a magnitude of 40 for a star. That value would be too faint for our telescopes, therefore that would skew the data. Second, sometimes measurements can't be made and values such as -999 is point in its place. This would again skew the data, giving values that does not make sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to look for stars at a specific cooridinate and do a radial search around that cooridinate. This poses another problem. We will be targeting stars both in our cluster and outside the cluster. This makes it difficult to generate the HR Diagram because this only works for stars in the same cluster which are at the same distance away. To identify stars in the cluster, will we target stars with the same proper motions. Using this fact, we can filter out the field stars and target the cluster starts. Once we are able to filter out those field stars, one can generate a HR Diagram of the cluster and begin analysis on the cluster. This activity will take you through these steps and validate with an animation that the cluster stars do move together with the same proper motion, as opposed to the field stars which vary in velocity.\n",

You will notice the standard clustering of points indicating the HR Diagram for star clusters, however, you will also notice a fair amount of stars in the diagram that are far away from this relation.

Technically, only the absolute (distance independent) magnitude is a direct proxy for luminosity, but because all the stars within the star cluster are at the same distance from us, their relative magnitude differences will still create the standard main sequence/giant branch/horizontal branch kind of shape. \n",
