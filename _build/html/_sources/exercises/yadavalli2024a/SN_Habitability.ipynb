    "## Introduction\n",
    "How many supernovae need to be continuously going off in a region of space for most of that space to be habitable? Imagine you have a rogue planet: one that has been ejected from its host star and is floating around its host galaxy in interstellar space. Imagine it is far enough away from its host star and from all other stars that the flux it receives from stars is negligible. As it floats around in its galaxy, is it possible that the planet can remain habitable just from the light and heat emitted by supernovae going off in the galaxy? How many supernovae would need to be going off in this galaxy so that such a rogue planet could actually be habitable?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In these exercises, you'll create a region of space shaped like a disk (approximating a spiral galaxy) and randomly sample locations in that space where there are planets and where there are supernovae going off. Then, you'll calculate how much energy each planet receives from all the supernovae going off. Finally, you'll calculate how many of those planets are habitable. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} On Habitability\n",
    ":class: note\n",
    "In this exercise, we only briefly explore planet habitability. We assume a planet will be habitable if the flux it receives is larger than the flux Mars receives from the Sun and smaller than the flux received by Venus from the Sun. However, habitability is far more complex than this, and depends on more factors, including the atmosphere of the planet and how regularly the flux received by the planet changes.\n",

We will use $\\rm{kpc}$ to represent distances within the galaxy, but make sure to convert those distances to $\\rm{cm}$ for the sake of calculating fluxes.\n",

    "1. Define a \"supernova density\": `n_sne_kpc3`, which defines how many supernovae are going off in the galaxy at any given time. This is the first simplification we will make in this calculation. For there to be enough flux in the galaxy that even rogue planets are habitable, there need to be so many supernovae going off in the galaxy continuously that we will not even consider how the light emitted by a single supernova changes over time. We will simply assume that at any point in time, a constant number of supernovae are currently active, and that each one is emitting an equal amount of total luminosity. Therefore, we will define a \"supernova density\"-how many are going off at a given time per cubic kiloparsec.\n",
    "2. Define the dimensions of the galaxy: `r_kpc` and `h_kpc`. We will assume the galaxy is a cylinder, with a radius and height in kiloparsecs\n",
    "3. Using the dimensions of the galaxy, calculate the volume and total number of supernovae going off continuously by multplying the supernova density by the volume of the galaxy\n",
    "4. Define a pixel count: `n_pixels`. We need to decide how many pixels we want to use to describe our galaxy. How many different coordinate locations do we want to generate, from which we will randomly pick planet locations and supernova locations? Then, we need to generate `n_pixels` number of random coordinate locations in the galaxy: `galaxy_locs`. We will do this in our first helper function: `get_random_locs()`. \n",
    "5. Define the number of planets: `n_planets`. Then, generate `n_planets` number of random coordinates: `planet_coordinates` by randomly choosing coordinates from `galaxy_locs`\n",
    "6. Generate `n_sne` number of random coordinates: sne_coordinates by randomly choosing coordinates from galaxy_locs. Note that I have set the `sne_lum` to $10^{44}~\\frac{erg}{s}$. This is the peak luminosity of some of the brightest supernovae we've seen! \n",
    "7. Define an array that can keep track of how much flux is absorbed by each planet: `planet_fluxes`. Also, keep track of the number of planets that are habitable: `num_habitable`, the number of planets that don't get enough flux to be habitable: `num_cold`, and the number of panets that get too much flux to be habitable: `num_hot`.\n",
    "8. Looping through the planets, for each planet, add up the amount of flux it received from each supernova (a double nested for loop, with one looping through the planets, and a nested one looping through the supernovae). Then, append the flux to the `planet_fluxes` list. Then calculate whether that planet, with the flux you just calculated, would be habitable, too hot, or too cold.\n",
    "9. Finally, return the variable `planet_fluxes` so we can make a histogram with how much flux each planet receives. \n",
