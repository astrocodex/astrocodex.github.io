    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Images taken by telescopes (both in space and on the ground) are a crucial element of astronomical research, providing a spatially resolved view of a region (generally at a particular wavelength). These images are predominantly stored in an astronomy-specific file type known as `fits` --- flexible image transport system (though tables can also be stored in `fits` files)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `astropy.io` module has a useful submodule for working with `fits` files, which can be imported as \n",
    "```\n",
    "from astropy.io import fits\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Within a `fits` file, information is stored in what are called *extensions*. These are like separate buckets/folders, and thus allow one to store multiple images, or an image + table, or multiple tables, within 1 file. But often, we have a simple file with 1 image in the 0th extension. Every extension present in a `fits` file has two `attributes`: a `.header` attribute, and a `.data` attribute. The header is like a dictionary, storing ancillary information in key-value pairs, while the data attribute stores the image, table, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we load a `fits` file, we usually also want to know something about the coordinates (on the sky, so RA and DEC) of the objects in our image. To do this, we need to know the `WCS` (world coordinate system) information for the image, which provides a translation between position in pixel (image) coordinates and sky coordinates. For many astronomical images you will work with, this information has been added to the `.header` attribute for the extension of the image. The `astropy.wcs.WCS` class can be given such a header, and compute a `wcs` object that will be useful when we go to plot or determine locations in our image. We can import it via \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "from astropy.wcs import WCS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So how do we actually open a `fits` file and retrieve the image and header? We'll use a pythonic structure known as a [context manager](https://realpython.com/python-with-statement/). The details of context managers aren't super important right now, but the key point is this: **context managers let us open contexts and close them automatically**. For files, this means we can open a `fits` file, extract what we need, and close the file automatically. \n",

    "The `fits` file we will be using here is an image of M33 taken by the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper. \n",

    "To open a simple image `fits` file using a context manager, we do something like the following:\n",

    "from astropy.wcs import WCS \n",
    "\n",
    "with fits.open('./M33_halpha.fits') as hdu:\n",
    "    im = hdu[0].data \n",
    "    wcs = WCS(hdu[0].header)\n",
    "```\n",

    "1. Using the `M33_halpha.fits` file provided, use the above snippet in your own code to open the image. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What happened in the snippet?\n",
    "- First, we said \"with fits.open()\" to establish it as a context manager, provided the file path, and gave the overall object the name `hdu`\n",
    "- Next, within the block, we set `im` to be the `hdu` indexed at 0 (0th extension) and used dot-notation to extract the `.data` attribute \n",
    "- Finally, we set a `wcs` variable to be the `astropy` `WCS` class, given the same extension but the `.header` attribute.\n",

    "## Writing an Image Opening Function\n",
    "\n",
    "We can, if we wish, encapsulate this operation into a function. It's short enough that it's not *overly* onerous to write out each time. But we can make these three lines into one, which might make our code easier to read when loading many different `fits` files throughout a script. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that a `function` in Python is, like a mathematical function, designed to take input *arguments* (when needed) and *return* values back. So $y = sin(x)$ is a function which takes $x$ as an argument and returns something, which has been named $y$ here. The default structure of a simple python function is \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function_name(arg1_name,arg2_name):\n",
    "    computation = arg1_name * arg2_name \n",
    "    return computation\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we use `def` to define a function (lines within the function are indented), and within the function, we assign inputs names to use when computing things, before returning some final value(s) if required. \n",

    "1. Start by defining a function `load_fits` which has arguments `fname` (`str`), and `extension` (`int`). These are the pieces of information we needed above. \n",
    "2. Then add these lines above into the function trading out the hard coded elements for the function arguments. \n",
    "3. Finally, `return im, wcs`. As the majority of `fits` image store the image in the 0th extension, you can set the default for that argument to 0. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Use the matplotlib `imshow` command to plot the M33 image. To see anything useful, you will need to set the `vmin` and `vmax` arguments --- a convenient choice is to compute the `np.percentile` of the data at `[1,99]` and to set those as the min and max scalings. \n",
    "2. Additionally set `origin='lower'` and `cmap='viridis'` in your imshow call. \n",
    "\n",
    "I suggest a figure size of 10 by 10 inches. Remember we can call `fig, ax = plt.subplots()` to make our figure and axes objects (so here, `fig,ax=plt.subplots(figsize=(10,10))`). We then use `ax.imshow(...)` to add images to the axes.\n",

    "## A function for Image Viewing\n",
    "\n",
    "The code to visualize the image above is already a few lines of code, and we *often* need to plot astronomical images. Let's now make a function that can streamline some of these lines of code above for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "::::{exercise} \n",
    ":class: dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First define a function `implot`. The first argument should be a variable `path_or_pixels`. We're going to allow users to either provide a file name to a `fits` file directly, or provide an image array (as we did above). To handle this, write some logic using the `isinstance()` python function to check whether the input is an array or a string, and if it is a string, use the `load_fits` function we wrote in Exercise 1 to load the image. (Otherwise, we'll just set our image to be the `path_or_pixels` input, assuming it is an array. You could use `isinstance()` again to check if it is a numpy array and raise an exception if not, optionally.)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Include as arguments the following: \n",
    "-  `percentiles` (`list`) (which will let users scale `vmin` and `vmax`, set to a default of `[1,99.5]`).\n",
    "-  `figsize` (`tuple`): an optional argument with a default set to something like (8,8).\n",
    "- `cmap` (`str`): argument with a default of `'gray_r'`, passed along the `imshow` command, giving us control over the plotting color mapping. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your function should `return` the `fig` and `ax` objects it created. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{admonition} _Hint: isinstance()_\n",
    ":class: dropdown \n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't used `isinstance()` yet, here's a primer. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we want to check the `type` of a variable, we can use `type(var_name)` to see its typename. When we want to check or ensure that a variable's type matches some desired type, we can use `isinstance(variable,type)` to return `True` or `False`. For example, `isinstance('test',str)` would return true, because the input `'test'` is a string. The names for the built-in types are `str`,`bool`,`list`,`dict`,`tuple`,`float`,`int`, etc. For a `numpy` array, its \"type\" is `np.ndarray`. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Try out your function to make sure it is working as expected --- try inputting both our image array from above, as well as the file name. Try changing the percentiles and figsize and make sure the function responds accordingly. \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Currently, a `wcs` will be accessible if the user provides the path to a file that has one. Now, add an optional argument to your function `wcs` with a default of `None` --- this way, if a user has read in an image themselves (as we did above) they can provide both the array an the wcs. Add logic so that if the `wcs` is not `None` (either from loading an image, or after the function input), we add the following to our subplots command:\n",
    "```\n",
    "fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=figsize,subplot_kw={'projection':wcs})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this does is turn our regular axis into a `WCSAxis`, which can handle plotting astronomical units along the axes of our image. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Try your function again, but this time add the `wcs` we created when loading the image. How do your plot axes change?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. At the moment, the user *chooses* whether to provide a wcs for the pixels case, but we *force* a wcs plotting if a path to a fits file that contains a wcs is provided. This should be the default case, but it might be nice to give the option to turn that off. The easiest way to accomplish this is to add an `ignore_wcs` optional argument to your function which has a default of `False`. Thus, given an image file path, we can plot using coordinates by default, or the raw pixels by ignoring any wcs present. This works too if we provide a wcs but want to easily toggle it on and off.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Try out your function again, using both the fits file string and the array, but now try all your toggles --- i.e., fits file string, fits file string plus 'ignore_wcs' if you added that feature, array input, array input + wcs object input. Do you get the proper behavior? Below is an example of what the output should look like for default loading of the image.\n",

    "There are now a decent number of lines of logic and checking in our function, and hopefully it is becoming clear why making such a function is so useful --- we can now very quickly and easily load and plot any fits file, or any array we have on hand, with `wcs` on or off, with limits setting, all in one line. \n",
    "\n",
    ":::{note}\n",
    "It is a good idea to `return` the `fig` and `ax` objects at the end of our function. This is useful because if we want to add to our plot (say, add a circle somewhere, or text), or *change* our plot (adjust the limits, etc.) we need to be able to access those objects. As we learned when we discussed **scope**, anything from inside a function that we want access to after the function has been run must be `returned` back to the larger scope of the python script we are working in.\n",
