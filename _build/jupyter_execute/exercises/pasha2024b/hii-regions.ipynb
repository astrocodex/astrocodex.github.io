    "Stars form of many different masses (from much smaller than the sun to **much** larger), with many more low mass stars forming than massive stars. While very few high mass (e.g., 3-10+ $M_{\\odot}$) stars form at a time in a galaxy, they have an outsized effect, dominating the light of the low mass stars (though they live much shorter lives). They are also the only stars (dubbed O-type) who put out significant light in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum. We know that our own sun does emit *some* light in the UV (that's the more high energy, dangerous light that can give us cancer, hence sunscreen), but these stars pump out *most* of their light in the UV. \n",
    "\n",
    "UV light has enough energy to *ionize* the atoms in gas (especially hydrogen gas), which means to knock the bound electron out of the atom and leave behind a proton and an electron. In some equilibrium, these electrons *recombine* with protons, and the electrons *cascade* through several energy levels as they fall toward the ground (most bound) state. For each gap they drop, the atom emits a photon with an equivalent energy to the difference between the levels traversed. \n",
    "\n",
    "This process of recombination produces light at specific wavelengths, so when you look at planetary nebulae, star forming regions, or supernova remnanta (see below), the colors are representitive of the different elements and energy levels being traversed. \n",
    "\n",

    "*The Eagle Nebule, where we can see the hollow region being blown out by young stars (with the famous pillars of creation remaining), soon to be whittled down. Credit: ESO*\n",
    "\n",
    "Bright, young stars actually put out enough radiation to \"blow out\" and push on the gas remaining from the clouds from which they formed. This carves our roughly spherical regions known as Strömgen spheres, the inner boundary of which is usually lit up in this ionized emission. The *size* of the sphere blown out depends on the total amount of flux coming from the bright stars, which in turn depends on how many of them there are. \n",

    "In this exercise, we will be using an image of M33 taken by the Dragonfly Spectral Line Mapper. \n",

    "You can download it [here](../pasha2024a/M33_halpha.fits) (right click and save as a `.fits` file). \n",

    "In our image of M33, we can see lots of these roughly spherical regions being highlighted by the narrow, H$\\alpha$ filter being used to observe the galaxy. By measuring their size in pixels and using our knowledge of the distance to M33, we can perform some simple trigonometry to determine their actual physical sizes. As a bonus, we can then roughly estimate the number of O-type stars responsible for the visible HII region. (note that Starforming region and HII region are roughly synonymous; HII is the chemical name for ionized hydrogen).\n"

    "## Finding a Region \n",
    "\n",
    "While we can see by eye lots of small HII regions scattered around M33 in our image, to do a more careful analysis of the sizes we will need a way to crop our images to just focus on one HII region at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are fundamentally two ways to carry out this crop. We can work in units of image pixels, and use *array indexing* and *slicing* to select subarrays containing out HII regions. Or, we could use our `wcs` objects to pick central coordinates on the sky and a size (in sky angular units) to crop in on, and use an `astropy` tool to do the crop. \n",

    "Our first step is actually determining the *pixel coordinates* of a given HII region. While there are more complex methods we could write, it is not so hard to do this by eye. That said, a simple `crosshairs` function would help us know that our chosen coordinates land right on an HII region. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function `crosshairs` which takes in `crosshairs(ax,x,y)`. It should then use `ax.axvline(x)` and similarly `ax.axhline(y)` for `y` to plot a crosshairs over our image at some coordinates. Return `ax` when done.\n",

Write a function `add_circle(ax,x,y,r)` which takes in our image `ax`, creates an array of `theta` values from 0 to $2\\pi$ (Hint: `np.linspace()` is good for this), computes the arrays for the x and y positions of the circle based on its center and radius, plots them using `ax.plot(x,y)` over the image, and returns the ax.\n",

    "So starting with a center of 25,25 makes sense here. If you want to know what these coordinates refer to back in the original image, you'll have to do a coordinate transformation to \"uncrop\" them --- calculate the coordinates of the left and bottom edge of the crop region and add the new center in $x,y$ to those. \n",

    "We don't need to do that here, as we're interested in $R$ (which is preserved in the crop as the pixel scale has not changed), but not the precise $x$ or $y$ in original image coordinates.\n",

    "Now that we have a measurement of $R_{HII}$ in pixels, we need to begin converting this to a physical scale. We can do this because we know the *pixel scale* of our detector, that is, how many angular degrees (here we'll use the arcsecond) on sky does one pixel subtend. For example, if we have a pixel scale of 2.2, that means each pixel subtends 2.2 arcseconds on sky (roughly 0.0006 degrees). \n",

    "We can then make a triangle --- the long edge is the distance in physical units to M33. The short edge is the length we want, the physical radius of the HII region, and $\\theta$ is our measured angular radius, obtained by multiplying the radius in pixels by the pixel scale. \n",

Using the pixel scale, it should convert the size `s_pix` to arcseconds, then onward to degrees (there are 3600 arcseconds in a degree), then onward to radians for the trig function (`np.deg2rad()` may be useful here). Then, using that, compute the size using the formula above and return it. The size output will have units equal to the length units that were assumed for $D$. \n",
